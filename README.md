# Designing an Adaptive Trial to Address Noncompliance

Here we have the simulation code for the 4 Bayesian imputation-based models and the two alternative estimation procedures, along with the true data generation and analysis file. Each of the Bayesian models have their own file beginning with their corresponding name in the paper. We provide the simulation code for the "Design Assumptions" simulation.
